Ch 2
JS uses camel case
in REPL no need to console log a var to print it
once you declare a var with var = blah, reassignment doesnâ€™t need any var declaration

Ch 3 : Types
types of types: primitive are built-in and immutable, objects are created and can change
primitive types: boolean, null, undefined, number, string
strings are immutable but can be concatenated 

Ch4 : Objects
objects are mutable, just a collection of properties (ex. string object has a length by definition)
if try to get length of a number, get undefined
(6).length so interp not think 6. 
declare objects with {}, so var imAnObject = {}
check type with typeof, so typeof imAnObject;

Ch5 : Arrays
